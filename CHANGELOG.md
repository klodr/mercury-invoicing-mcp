# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.7] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- `.github/workflows/verify-release.yml` — Path 1 `npm install` now downloads
  the tarball explicitly, verifies its SHA-1 against the registry-published
  `dist.shasum`, and installs the local file (instead of `npm install
  <pkg>@<version>`). Fixes Scorecard `Pinned-Dependencies` finding.
  Functionally equivalent install (still `--ignore-scripts`), but every byte
  that hits `node_modules` is hash-verified against registry metadata.
  Symmetric to klodr/faxdrop-mcp v0.1.6.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- `.github/workflows/verify-release.yml` — `gh attestation verify` now also
  passes `--cert-identity` (in addition to `--signer-workflow` and
  `--source-ref`) to lock the exact Fulcio SAN encoded in the attestation
  certificate, matching what cosign verifies in Path 3. `--signer-workflow`
  alone matches the workflow file but not the ref encoded in the SAN; the
  added flag closes the last latitude.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Post-release verification workflow** (`.github/workflows/verify-release.yml`):
  re-exercises the three SECURITY.md verification paths (`npm audit signatures`,
  `gh attestation verify`, `cosign verify-blob-attestation`) on every published
  release. Runs on `workflow_run: completed` of `Release & npm publish` and
  fails fast if provenance, the Sigstore bundle, or the attached release assets
  drift. cosign installed via `sigstore/cosign-installer@v4.1.1` (SHA-pinned).

### Documentation

- `SECURITY.md`: extended the "single-process semantics" entry with an
  explicit "persistent unreadable state" paragraph. On chronic `EACCES`/`EIO`
  on the state file the middleware preserves the prior counter (does not
  overwrite) and falls back to an in-memory cap valid for the current
  process only — i.e. the cross-restart guarantee degrades to "cross-call
  within one session". Mercury's server-side limits remain the load-bearing
  control under that condition.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **Rate-limit state now survives process restarts.** MCP hosts that respawn the
  server per session (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor with stdio transport)
  used to silently reset the in-memory `callHistory`, defeating the daily caps.
  State is now persisted to `~/.mercury-mcp/ratelimit.json` (mode `0o600`,
  atomic write via `rename`). Override the location with the new
  `MERCURY_MCP_STATE_DIR` env var. Corrupted state files are detected and the
  middleware starts fresh with a logged warning. Tests added: cross-restart
  enforcement, mode `0o600` verification, corrupted-file recovery.

### Documentation

- `SECURITY.md`: new entry under "What this MCP does NOT protect against"
  describing prompt injection through Mercury response data — counterparty-
  controlled fields (`customer.name`, `recipient.note`, invoice memos,
  transaction descriptions) are forwarded verbatim to the LLM. Reminder that
  read-then-write chains require explicit user confirmation.
- `SECURITY.md` + `README.md`: documented `MERCURY_MCP_STATE_DIR` and the
  cross-restart guarantee.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- `codeql.yml` + `scorecard.yml`: pinned `github/codeql-action` to the **commit SHA** of v4.35.2 (`95e58e9a…`) instead of the SHA of the annotated tag object (`7fc6561…`). OpenSSF Scorecard's "imposter commit" verification rejected the tag-object SHA with HTTP 400. Same fix on `klodr/faxdrop-mcp`.
- `README.md`: CodeQL badge now points at our explicit Advanced workflow (`actions/workflows/codeql.yml/badge.svg`) instead of the unused GitHub Default Setup URL — badge now shows passing/failing instead of just the wordmark.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- `codeql.yml` + `scorecard.yml`: bumped `github/codeql-action` from v3 to **v4.35.2** (SHA-pinned `7fc6561…`). v3 EOL is December 2026 and the underlying actions still ran on Node 20, which GitHub deprecates in September 2026; v4 runs on Node 24.
- Tooling consistency with `klodr/faxdrop-mcp`: ESLint v9 flat config with `typescript-eslint` type-aware rules; Prettier + `eslint-config-prettier`; `Lint & Format` CI job gating every PR; TypeScript strict + `noUnusedLocals/noUnusedParameters/noImplicitReturns/noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`; jest `restoreMocks: true` to auto-restore spies between tests. Already on `main` since PRs #25/#26; surfaced in this release for the npm changelog.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- `SECURITY.md`: switched the `cosign verify-blob-attestation` example to `--bundle index.js.sigstore` (the actual Sigstore bundle file with the Fulcio cert chain + Rekor inclusion proof). The previous `--signature index.js.intoto.jsonl` form could not complete keyless verification on its own. The companion `index.js.intoto.jsonl` asset is documented as the SLSA-format file consumed by tools that scan release assets by extension (Scorecard `Signed-Releases`).
- `SECURITY.md`: softened the "vulnerable versions will trigger Dependabot alerts" line to a conditional "may trigger ... provided Dependabot security updates are enabled" — alerts depend on the consuming repository's configuration.

### Fixed

- `scripts/sandbox-test.mjs`: removed two unused `const` assignments (`recipients`, `trAccs`) flagged by CodeQL alerts #20 / #21. The `await run(...)` calls remain for their smoke-test side effect.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- `test/fuzz.test.ts`: property-based tests using `fast-check`. Covers `redactSensitive` (no leak through any sensitive key at any depth, mixed-case variants exercise the case-folding path) and `MercuryError` (toString / toJSON never expose the response body, sentinel-based property). Recognised by OpenSSF Scorecard's `Fuzzing` check (8/10 → 10/10).
- `release.yml`: now also emits `dist/index.js.intoto.jsonl` (SLSA in-toto attestation extracted from the Sigstore bundle's DSSE envelope, with non-null guard) alongside `dist/index.js.sigstore`. Lifts Scorecard's `Signed-Releases` check from 8/10 to 10/10.
- `CONTINUITY.md`: project continuity plan with a fork-and-continue takeover checklist (Best Practices Silver: `access_continuity`).
- `ASSURANCE_CASE.md`: threat model, trust boundaries, secure-design principles, CWE/OWASP weakness mapping (Best Practices Silver: `assurance_case`).
- `SECURITY.md`: explicit "Security model — what you can and cannot expect" section; "Verifying releases" section with three independent paths (npm CLI provenance, `gh attestation verify`, `cosign verify-blob-attestation`).

### Changed

- `src/middleware.ts`: `SENSITIVE_KEYS` is now exported and `Object.freeze`d so the fuzz tests can reuse the canonical list (no drift) and the array is immutable at runtime.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- `release.yml`: end-to-end automated release on `git push origin vX.Y.Z`. The workflow now extracts the matching `## [VERSION]` section from `CHANGELOG.md`, creates (or updates) the GitHub Release with those notes, signs `dist/index.js` with Sigstore, attaches the signed bundle, and `npm publish --provenance`. No manual UI step.
- `release.yml`: added a sanity check that the pushed tag matches `package.json`'s `version` — fails fast on mismatched bumps.
- `release.yml`: changelog link in the auto-generated release notes pinned to `/blob/${TAG}/CHANGELOG.md` (was `/blob/main/`) so it stays authoritative for the release it accompanies.
- `release.yml`: GitHub Release creation is idempotent (`view` then `edit` if it exists, `create` otherwise) so re-runs after a later-step failure are not blocked.
- `codeql.yml`: matrix now includes both `javascript-typescript` and `actions` languages. Replaces the deleted auto-generated `codeql-analysis.yml` whose duplicate job name was triggering parallel runs and confusing the required `Code scanning results / CodeQL` status check.

### Added

- README: OpenSSF Best Practices badge ([project 12575](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/12575), passing tier).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- `release.yml`: replaced the incorrect `@sigstore/cli@1.0.0` install (no such version, no `sign` subcommand) with `actions/attest-build-provenance@v4.1.0`. The v0.6.0 release run failed at the install step, so 0.6.0 was never published to npm — 0.6.1 ships the same code as 0.6.0 plus a working signing pipeline.
- `release.yml`: added a `BUNDLE_PATH` guard before `cp` so a missing attestation output produces a self-explanatory error instead of a generic `cp` failure.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- `release.yml`: Sigstore (keyless OIDC) signing of `dist/index.js`. The signed artifact + `.sigstore` bundle are uploaded to the GitHub Release before npm publish. Satisfies Scorecard's `Signed-Releases` check (npm provenance alone is not enough — Scorecard inspects GitHub Release assets).
- `release.yml`: split into two jobs (`build` read-only, `publish` write + release-only) for least-privilege token scopes.

### Removed

- README: Snyk vulnerability badge. Snyk deprecated the `/test/github/{owner}/{repo}/badge.svg` endpoint (HTTP 410 Gone). The Snyk GitHub App still runs on every PR (visible as `security/snyk` status check), so the protection itself is unchanged — only the README badge had to go.

### Changed
- `lineItemSchema.name` now enforces `.min(1).max(200)` at the Zod level. Mercury silently accepts longer names on `POST /ar/invoices` (create) but rejects them on the edit endpoint with `"Item name: Must be 200 characters or fewer"`, leaving the invoice in an unmodifiable state. The MCP now refuses upfront with a clean validation error.
- `invoiceNumber` now enforces `.max(255)`. Mercury accepts up to ~280 characters and rejects 300+, so 255 is a safe ceiling that also matches typical varchar(255) database conventions.

### Tested but not enforced (no schema-level limit needed)
- `payerMemo`, `internalNote`, `customer.name` all accept ≥5000 characters in production. No artificial limit added.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **`mercury_create_internal_transfer`** — move money between two of your own Mercury accounts (e.g. Checking → Savings). `POST /transfer`, with auto-generated `idempotencyKey`.
- **`mercury_update_recipient`** — fix a recipient's nickname / contact email / payment method without recreating it. `POST /recipient/{id}` (singular).
- **`mercury_update_webhook`** — change a webhook's URL, status (active/paused) or event types. Useful to reactivate a webhook that was disabled after consecutive delivery failures. `POST /webhooks/{id}`.
- `defineTool` and `textResult` helpers in `src/tools/_shared.ts` (eliminates the per-handler `JSON.stringify` boilerplate across all 34 tools).
- `scripts/sync-version.mjs` — single-source the package version: `package.json` is authoritative, the script propagates it into `server.json` and `src/server.ts`. Wired to the `npm version` lifecycle hook.

### Changed
- **Breaking** — `mercury_update_transaction` no longer takes `accountId`. Mercury's real endpoint is `PATCH /transaction/{id}` (no account in the path). Fields are now `note` (nullable) and `categoryId` (nullable); `externalMemo` was never accepted by the endpoint and has been removed.
- **Breaking** — env var renamed: `MERCURY_MCP_RATE_LIMIT_disabled` → `MERCURY_MCP_RATE_LIMIT_DISABLE` (consistent uppercase).
- **Breaking** — `lineItemSchema` now requires `name` (was `description`). Mercury rejects line items without `name`. `description` becomes an optional longer-form field.
- `mercury_update_invoice` now uses the correct Mercury endpoint: `POST /ar/invoices/{id}` (not PATCH). The handler fetches the current invoice, merges the supplied changes, and submits the full payload that Mercury expects — callers can still pass only the fields they want to change.
- Audit log: sensitive args (`accountNumber`, `routingNumber`, `apiKey`, `authorization`, `password`, `token`, `secret`, `ssn`) now redacted to `[REDACTED]`. Path must be absolute. File created with mode `0o600`. Write is now synchronous.
- Dry-run `wouldCallWith` payload now also redacts sensitive fields.
- `MercuryError.toString()` and `toJSON()` no longer include the raw response body (kept on the `body` property for callers who need it).
- Tool registration goes through a `defineTool` helper that calls the SDK's non-deprecated `server.registerTool` (the previous monkey-patch on `server.tool` is gone).
- `wrapToolHandler` now catches `MercuryError` and returns a clean `isError:true` response, with a hint for HTTP 403 on AR endpoints (Mercury Plus plan required).
- All path-injected IDs (`accountId`, `transactionId`, `recipientId`, `webhookId`) now require `.uuid()` validation, and `MercuryClient.request` URL-encodes each path segment (defense-in-depth against prompt injection).
- Sandbox auto-detection now uses a strict prefix match (`apiKey.startsWith("secret-token:mercury_sandbox_")`) instead of a substring check.
- `fetch` requests now have a 30s `AbortSignal.timeout` so a hung Mercury endpoint cannot block the MCP indefinitely.

### Removed
- **`mercury_send_invoice`** — Mercury does NOT expose `POST /ar/invoices/{id}/send` (404 confirmed in production). Email delivery is only triggered by `sendEmailOption: "SendNow"` at invoice creation time. Documented in `mercury_create_invoice`.
- Internal references to non-existent Mercury tools (COA Templates ×3, Journal Entries ×3) cleaned from `TOOL_CATEGORIES` and `DEFAULT_LIMITS_PER_DAY`.
- Unused `MercuryClient.put()` helper.

### Fixed
- Node 18 compatibility: `randomUUID` imported from `node:crypto` (the global `crypto.randomUUID()` requires Node 19+).

### Security
- All GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/` are now pinned by full commit SHA (was tag-based, vulnerable to tag rewriting). `release.yml` is the highest-risk workflow — it carries `NPM_TOKEN`.
- Sourcemaps are emitted only when `NODE_ENV !== "production"`. The published npm tarball no longer ships `dist/index.js.map` (which would otherwise expose the full TypeScript source). `prepublishOnly` sets `NODE_ENV=production`.
